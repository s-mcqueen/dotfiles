vimrc
=====

My .vimrc file

Plugins I currently use:
* [Supertab] (https://github.com/ervandew/supertab)
* [Vim-Gitgutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter)
* [Vim-Colors-Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized)
* []()

TODO:
This could use a butt-load of cleanup, reorganization and commenting. This has been cobbled together from lots of vimrc files I've found on the web.
