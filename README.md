vimrc
-------------

While trying to teach myself vim, I've spent a lot of time working on customizing my vim enviroment and workflow. Most of my vimrc has been cobbled together from vimrc files I've found on github and people's blogs. At some point I'll come back through this and clean it up.

My favorite plugins:
* [Supertab] (https://github.com/ervandew/supertab)
* [Vim-Gitgutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter)
* [Vim-Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
* [Vim-Colors-Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized)
* [NerdTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
* [Ctrlp](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim)

bash profile
-------------

Nothing insane in my bash profile, except maybe some git integration scripts I've stolen from other folks. Like every programmer in the world, I think my bash aliases are the best. (But mine actually are.)
